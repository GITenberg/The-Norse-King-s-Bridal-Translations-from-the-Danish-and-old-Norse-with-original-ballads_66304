<h3><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE"></a>AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h3>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">In</span> these translations from the Danish I have adhered strictly to the
metres of the original; this, however, is not the case with those from
the Old Norse. The original ballads are not versifications of Northern
legends, but, like those in my previous volume, so far as matter goes,
pure inventions of my own.</p>

<p>The “Drowning of John Remorsson” is, according to Professor Gründtvig,
in treatment, though not in subject, a Danish parallel to the Scottish
“Sir Patrick Spens.” “Agnes and the Merman” seems to me interesting, as
having possibly suggested to Matthew Arnold his “Forsaken Merman.”</p>

<p>With regard to “The Awakening of Angantheow” and “The Lay of Thrym,” I
have little but apologies to offer. No one can be more sensible than
myself of their short-comings. My excuse is, that I could learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span> of no
other English metrical versions&mdash;and we all know <i>who</i> rush in where
angels fear to tread! If my inadequacies exasperate some better poet
than myself to the production of versions nearer to the magnificent
originals, they will at least have justified their existence.</p>

<p><i>NOTE.&mdash;Swafurlami, a king of the seed of Odin, stole the sword Tyrfing
(ripper) from the dwarfs who forged it. They laid on it a curse&mdash;that it
should bring death to its bearer; that no wound made by it should be
healed; and that three deeds of woe should be wrought by it. Swafurlami
is slain by Arngrim, who inherits the sword. Eyfura, his wife, has
twelve sons, all of whom become Vikings. Angantheow, the eldest, and his
brothers, are eventually all slain near Upsala by Hjalmar, and his
brother Arrow-Odd; but Hjalmar, being wounded by Tyrfing, has only time
to sing his death-song before he dies.</i></p>

<p><i>Angantheow’s daughter, Herwor (by his wife Tofa) is brought up as a
bond-maid, in ignorance of her parentage. When at last she learns it,
the war-fury comes upon her; she arms herself as an Amazon, and goes to
Munarvoe in Samsey, in quest of the dwarf-doomed weapon. The following
poem concerns her dialogue with her dead father, his yielding up to her
of Tyrfing, and his prophecy of the further doom its possession will
bring upon her race.</i></p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
